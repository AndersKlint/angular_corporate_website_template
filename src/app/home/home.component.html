          <h3>
            You can even have sub-titles!
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are a lot of different titles, for example: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. They are styled in the main stylesheet called
            styles.scss, located in the src/app/ folder. You can also search the internet for more text html tags.
          </p>

          <div class="centered-image" style="width: 50%;">
            <img class="image-border" src="assets/beach_bridge.jpg" alt="Knugen picture" width="100%">
            <i class="image-caption">
              This is an image of a bridge. It was constructed somwhere between the birth of
              Jesus Christ (our lord and saivour) and today.
            </i>
          </div>

          <h4 class="custom-h4">
            This is a custom h4 title for this component
          </h4>

          <p>
            Check src/app/home/home.component.scss for the custom-h4 class to modify it. You can do the same with parahraphs.
            If you set margin-left to 4% for example, you will get in-dented text.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a list example.</li>
            <li>The ul-tag stands for unordered list.</li>
            <li>There is also an ol-tag for ordered lists</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight:bold;">
              This is an example of bold text.
            </span>
            Note that you can both style directly in the tag like this example code, or you can
            style properly in the .scss file. In this example we can style directly in the tag since we're only setting the font
            weight to bold, which makes it convinient. You can also set the font weight to other stuff like italics. Google it.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div>
            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">
              If you set margin-left to 4% for example, you will get in-dented text. This can be done either in a stylesheet with
              class, or with an "in-line" style like this example (check style= in the p-tag).
